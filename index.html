                    <h2>The Beginning of the New Era​</h2>
                    <p>
                        King Abdulaziz was in his twenties when left Kuwait leading a handful of his relatives and aids towards Riyadh, by then he was about 26 years old. The Arab peninsula was in a mess. But on the 15th of January 1902
                        King Abdulaziz was able to enter Riyadh City victoriously and the Arab peninsula witnessed a new era. He took over both the political and religious powers when his father, Imam Abdurrahman bin Faisal stepped down for
                        him. This took place in the Grand Mosque after the Jumaah prayer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gradually, the new King started to unite Najd area beginning with southern Riyadh when he defeated his opponents in an area called Dalam near Kharj thereby taking over all towns of southern Riyadh including Kharj, Al
                        Hareeq, al Aflaj and Wadi Al Dawasir.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        King Abdulaziz then went to Al Washam area and conquered its capital city Shagra and then went on to Thadiq and the capital of Sudair Al Majmaah. This was culminated in uniting all these areas under his rule and
                        became part of what is known as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
                    </p>
                    <p>King Abdulaziz was able to conquer Gasim area in the 1321/1324 after several minor battles but the last and decisive one was Raudat Mahannah on the 14th of April 1906.</p>
